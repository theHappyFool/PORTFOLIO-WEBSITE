				The benefits
				This will improve human behaviour (online), which is a very positive thing in general 
				for everyone. This impact can be huge for humanity because more than half of humanity uses the internet.
				Prosecuting negative communication online will greatly stimulate people to behave better and treat each other less bad. Less bad means a better average. Improving how humans treat each other will greatly benefit society , as this impacts all internet users, which is more than half of the human population. This will result in less anxiety, a drop in suicide rate and depression which will further snowball into a more flourishing society.
				This can be expanded
				This could be expanded into rewarding positive communication towards people 
				online. This will also motivate people to improve their behaviour.
				If algorithms can be written to track down the bad stuff, than the opposite is also possible. And positive rewards are a greater motivation than punishing the negative.  Humans are sensitive to compliments and who doesn’t want to unlock an increasingly higher milestone of good karma online to show off? These game mechanics are addictive; they have been proven to be effective. 
				 Sounds good, but what are the downsides?
				The complications
				One might argue that the internet can be compared to being off-planet: in space. It is everywhere, and thus not bound to any laws of a specific country. And because every country has its own laws, it would be impossible to make laws for the internet, for the same reason that we simply cannot elect a president for the whole world.
				However, all countries on earth have agreed that crimes are forbidden and while the punishments may differ per country, they are all being punished none the less. Bad behaviour is not tolerated by any laws in any country, so why should we tolerate it on the internet?
				It is true. Laws exist for a reason. Any country that has them prosecutes the bad stuff. There is literally no exception. However, expressing one’s freedom of opinion is not punished as bad everywhere. But the point is, that it is punished everywhere ; it doesn’t matter to what extent.
